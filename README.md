WebRTC Internals
================

Goal is to replace react-sparklines in Discord with chrome://webrtc-internals style graphs. Please see [https://github.com/fippo/webrtc-externals](https://github.com/fippo/webrtc-externals). `timeline_data_series.js' and 'timeline_graph_view.js' are taken from [https://github.com/fippo/webrtc-externals/blob/master/webrtc-internals.js#L207-L341] and [https://github.com/fippo/webrtc-externals/blob/master/webrtc-internals.js#L510-#L1063], respectively.
